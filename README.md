# HOLZ_Isabelle2014
An effort to port the HOLZ sourcecode from Isabelle2005 to Isbelle2014 so that theorem proving for Z specifications can be carried out in Isabelle 2014 and hopefully (if maintained) in future versions of Isabelle theorem prover.

The old HOLZ3 is included in the repository for reference.

We plan to mechanize the mathematical toolkit first, so that Z data structures can be used in HOL predicates.

Contributions are welcome :)

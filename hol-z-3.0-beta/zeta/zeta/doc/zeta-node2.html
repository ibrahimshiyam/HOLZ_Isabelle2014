1. Tutorial Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> system can be run in one of three operation modes:

<P>
 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>from within the XEmacs editor<A NAME="tex2html2"
HREF="zeta-footnode.html#foot51"><SUP>1</SUP></A>;
<DT>2.
<DD>with a graphical user interface (based on Java's Swing
  library)<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="zeta-footnode.html#foot52"><SUP>2</SUP></A>;
<DT>3.
<DD>in a batch-oriented mode, where Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> reads its commands
  from standard input and echos the results to standard output
</DL>

<P>
In fact, the first two modes base on the third one, which represents
the ``core'' functionality of Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>. However, in this tutorial
introduction, we will explain Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>'s features along its graphical
user interface.

<P>
 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Remark</I>:We assume that Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> has been successfully installed at your site.

1.1 Starting a session</A>
</H2>

<P>
Make a working copy of the <TT>$ZETABASE/examples</TT> directory (where
<TT>$ZETABASE</TT> is the installation base of Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>). We call
this copy <TT>examples</TT> in the sequel.

<P>
Change to the directory <TT>examples/bbook</TT>, which contains the
well-known example of the birthday-book specification, and type
<TT>zeta&amp;</TT> from the shell.

<P>

You should get the following window:

</DIV>

<P>
This window is the Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> <I>commander</I>. The commander's menu allows
you to access the operations of Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>, and to launch further
windows, as will be explained below. The window displays the so-called
<I>session log</I>. The session log consists of <I>transactions</I>
which are indicated by the little lightening icon to the left.  The
messages belonging to a transaction are displayed intended to a
description of the transaction. In the window above, we see the
transaction of initialization of Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>, with a set of <I>progress
  messages</I> (these are indicated by the ``running man''), telling
which <I>plugins</I> have been installed for your Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> session. The
actual number of plugins depends on your Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> setup.

<P>
You can click on the lightening icon of a transaction to fold resp. unfold
the messages belonging to this transaction.

1.2 Loading sources</A>
</H2>

<P>
Before you can work with your documents, they have to be <I>loaded</I>
into the Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> session. Documents to be initially loaded can be
specified from the command line (<code>zeta doc1.tex doc2.tex ...</code>),
or laterly loaded via via the <TT>Source</TT> menu of the commander or
the tool bar. Activate

 SRC="zeta-img3.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig {file=loadlatex.eps,scale=0.7}">
</DIV>

<P>
Type in <TT>bbook.tex</TT> into the botton panel, or select the file
via the file browser. Then hit the button with the file-folder icon
(note that this is the same icon which represents this function in the
tool bar).  The effect of loading will be displayed in the session
log:

<P>
You see a progress message indicating that the L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X  source has
been scanned, and a check mark which tells you that this transaction
has been successfully finished.  The messages of the previous
transaction has been automatically folded. They are still there, you
can see them by clicking on the lightening icon.

<P>

<P>
 
<B>Loading.</B> What does the load operation conceptually means?
From the time on a source has been loaded into a Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> session, the
session ``takes care'' of this source. It monitors modifications you
make on the source (e.g. by some external editor), and whether results
of operations you have applied to the specifications contained in the
source are up-to-date (e.g. type-checking, compilation, etc.). This is
quite comparable to traditional Unix' <TT>make</TT>.

<P>
Note that you only need to load the main document of a compound document.
Subdocuments included from the main document will be automatically
tracked by Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
 
<B>Batch operation.</B> It would be cumbersome if each time you
start a Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> session, sources need to be loaded by hand again. You
can put the according load commands in a file called <TT>zetarc</TT>
in the working directory of a project.  In the <TT>examples/bbook</TT>
directory, you find a file <TT>zetarc.bbook</TT> with the following
content:

<P>
 
<PRE>
  # This file contains commands executed by ZETA on startup.
  # ZETA executes (if found) the following configuration files
  #    $ZETABASE/lib/zetarc
  #    $HOME/.zetarc
  #    ./zetarc

  # load the LaTeX sources of the birthday-book example:
  load bbook.tex
</PRE>

<P>
This file can be renamed to <TT>zetarc</TT>, so the next time a
Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> session is started from this directory, the source
<TT>bbook.tex</TT> will be automatically loaded. 

<P>
You may note that the string <TT>load bbook.tex</TT> is exactly
the same as displayed in the commanders session log to describe the
transaction of loading. In fact, any operation available from the GUI
eventually leads to a command which could be as well executed in batch
mode. 

<P>

1.3 Performing Operations</A>
</H2>

<P>
The operations of the Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> system can be reached via the menu
<TT>Operation</TT> or the tool bar. The provided operations
depend on which plugins have been installed for Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>. We
assume that you have at least the ESZ type-checker plugin and
the ZAP compiler plugin.

<P>

<P>
This window allows you to execute Z expressions.  You can choose
between evaluation modes and step through solutions which are
described in the <A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="zap.html"><I>ZAP manual</I></A>.

<P>
In order to perform an operation, you need to specify the Z section it
targets. This is done via the combobox at the left of the tool bar.
When loading a source, all available sections are scanned from the
source, and are made available for operations.  Clicking on the
combobox shows that the source <I>bbook.tex</I> has provided several
sections (see <A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="z.html"><I>The Z of Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL></I></A>
for more information
about Z sections).

<P>
 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Remark</I>:The sections in this example are the followings:
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL><LI><TT>LTX:BBSpec#bbook.tex</TT>: a section containing the basic
  specification of the birthday book;

<LI><TT>LTX:BBExec#bbook.tex</TT>: a section containing a refinement
  of the specification of the birthday book for the purpose of
  executability;

<LI><TT>LTX:BBTest#bbook.tex</TT>: a section containing a refinement
  of the executable specification for the purpose of test-case
  evaluation;

</UL><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">
For more details of the usage of these sections in the birthday book
example, see the birthday-book document.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Remark</I>:The name of a section (or, more generally, <I>units</I>) in Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>,
  is given by a so-called MSL (model source locator).  An MSL consists
  of (1) an identifier denoting the tool which has imported the
  unit into Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> (here, the L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X -tool) (2) the name of the
  unit (here, e.g.  <TT>BBExec</TT>) (3) tool specific data (here,
  for L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X , the name of the file where the section originates from).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To carry on with the example, let use choose the section
<TT>LTX:BBExec#bbook.tex</TT>. Next type in the text field
an expression, e.g. 
<!-- MATH
 $InitBirthdayBook$
 -->
<I>InitBirthdayBook</I>, and hit the apply
button. In the session log, you see some progress messages;
the tail of this output will look as follows:

<P>
In order to execute the given Z expression, Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> has operated a
compound tool-chain, which you completely see if you scroll or resize
the commander window: the Z toolkit this specification bases on
has been loaded, several sections have been parsed and
type-checked, and the section in which context the given expression is
to be executed has been reduced and
compiled. Finally, the result of the evaluation has been
printed (<code>{&lt;birthday == {}, known == {}&gt;}</code>).

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
 
<B>Lazy tool chains.</B>  Tool chains are executed ``lazily'' by
Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>. If you now hit again the <TT>Apply</TT> button of the
<TT>Execute</TT> panel, the result will be immediatly prompted.
But if the original source <TT>bbook.tex</TT> is modified
(e.g.&nbsp;by saying <TT>touch bbook.tex</TT> from a Unix shell), the
tool-chain is recomputed.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>
 
<B>Editing text fields.</B> The text field of the <TT>Execute</TT> panel,
as most other text fields in Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL>, provides a history. Stepping through
the history can be achieved by clicking on the up-arrow and down-arrow
in the left upper corner of the text field.

<P>
It is possible to perform cut, copy and paste on the text field, for
exchange with other applications. Note, however, that under X the Java
system addresses the <I>system clipboard</I>, not the current
selection. (The current selection is what is highlighted if you drag
the mouse over some text displayed in an X application.)

<P>
From within a text field, you can use the keys <TT>C-c</TT> and
<TT>C-v</TT> to copy into resp.&nbsp;paste from the system clipboard. 
Under XEmacs you can reach copy and paste for the system
clipboard via the tool bar.

<P>
In order to execute the text of a panel from an external editor, click
on the ``hand'' icon at the left bottom. This passes control on this
text field to an externally attached editor, usually XEmacs.

1.4 Browsing Locators</A>
</H2>

<P>
Diagnostics and other messages written in the session log may
contain so-called <I>locators</I>, which point to sources,
and which can be browsed by clicking on them. 

<P>
 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Remark</I>:To let locator browsing work, you need to have XEmacs 20 or later
  installed.  See <A NAME="tex2html7"

For trying out locators, enter e.g.&nbsp;the expression <code>BirthdayBook</code> into the

This log contains an error diagnostic which describes the failure of
the execution, caused by the attempt to enumerate the bindings of the
schema <I>BirthdayBook</I>.  You can click on the blue locators to visit
the sources referred to from the diagnostic. If XEmacs is already
running, it will be contacted to visit the file and highlight in this
file the region designated by the locator. If not, it will launched.

1.5 Cut and Paste</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Java based GUI of Z<SMALL>E</SMALL>T<SMALL>A</SMALL> does not implement special
facilities for cut and paste, but takes the defaults of
the Java implementation. You can use <code>C-v</code> to insert
and <code>C-c</code> to copy the selection.

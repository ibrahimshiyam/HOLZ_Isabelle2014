# Compiling Zeta requires the following environment:
# - ZETABASE should point to the top-level Zeta directory, i.e, 
#   the directory containing this file: 
    export ZETABASE=`pwd`  
# - JAVA_HOME should point to your Java 1.4 installation, e.g., 
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/fjsdk/
# - finally, your PATH should contain the Zeta bin directory:
    export PATH=$ZETABASE/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
#
# Zeta can be compiled and installed as follows:
# cd src
# etmake boostrap
# etmake install

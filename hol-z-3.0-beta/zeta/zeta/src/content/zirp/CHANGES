Changes ESPRESS-ZIRP --> ZETA-ZIRP
==================================

- Expr.Decl extended by a variant Expr.Decl.Eqn, since standard
  Z allows to have equations in schema text, e.g. [x == 1,y : Z | x < y]

- Expr.Abbrev dropped. Abbreviations are now expressed by
  Expr.Decl.Eqn.

- in Expr.Display the kind Expr.DisplayKind dropped, since 
  sequence and bag displays are no definable as mixfix-functions on
  user level.

- in Expr.Text the kind Expr.TextKind dropped (this kind determined
  whether its dynamic or static text). The flag for dynamic text
  goes to an annotation (class TextAttr).

- Item.SchemaDef vanished, since Standard Z makes no differences
  between normal names and schema names. Conceptually, the
  schema definition

  	S =^= E

  is equivalent to

  	S == E

  which in turn is equivalent to the axiomatic definition (using the
  new Expr.Decl.Eqn variant):

  	| S == E
	|----
	| true

- The role of an MSZ schema definition, formerly represented by
  Item.SchemaDef, is now represented as an annotation of
  NameDecl's (class DeclAttr).

- Unit renamed to UnitAbsy, since the notion of a unit in the
  session system is more general then just its Absy.

  UnitAbsy distinguishes two cases: Section (a Standard Z section,
  equals to what was formerly a unit) and ClassDef, a mSZ class.
  
  The ClassDef in turn doesn't appears as an individual item.

- Fixities simplified and synchronized with the standard --
  a fixity can be either generic or not, instead of individual
  components being generic or not.

- Item.StaticReactionDef and Item.TransitionDef: decls removed,
  since they are not included in the mSZ 1.0 language version

- The class Transition.Node is removed, transition nodes are now
  described as NameAppl.  Now, state and connector names are always
  prefixed by the chart name and, if necessary, the state-path:

      +-xorstate S--
      | S:A, S:B : BasicState
      | S:C : Connector
      | S:X : XorState
      | S:X:X1, S:X:X2 : BasicState
      | S:X:C Connector
      +--
      | S:A 	Goto S:X:C
      | S:X:C	Goto S:X:X1
      | ...

- There is a new case for State: RefState, describing a reference to
  an other chart (@MY_STATE in Statemate).  Upto now, state references
  were described as BasicState, and a BasicState was supposed to be
  interpreted as state reference if a chart with its name existed.

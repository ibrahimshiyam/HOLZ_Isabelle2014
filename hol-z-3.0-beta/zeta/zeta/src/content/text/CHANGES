Changes ESPRESS-TEXT --> ZETA-TEXT
==================================

- Two new markups ZedSection and ZedClass 

- ZedMarkupKind.Class removed -- its now represented by 
  a custom ZedClass.

  The reason for this is that information about the name of
  a class, it formal parameters, and it parents needs to be
  evaluated already on scanning level (in order to realize
  merging of different class boxes with the same name).

- ZedFixity and ZedMacro are own markups -- again, this has to
  be done to allow evaluation already on scanning level

- From the Config class, information about fixities and macros
  have been removed -- these are now found in zirp.UnitEnv.
  Reason: this information is in Standard Z part of the abstract
  language, not only the concrete language.

- The class LatexConfig is now found in tools/latex!

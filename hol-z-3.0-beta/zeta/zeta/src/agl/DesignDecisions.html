<h1>Remarks on an Aggregate Library for Pizza</h1>
<h4> by Robert B&uuml;ssow and Wolfgang Grieskamp, 10-97</h4>

This is a collection of remarks on design decisions taken for an
aggregate library for Pizza.<p>


<hr>
<h3>Supported Aggregates</h3>

<blockquote><cite>
      The basic aggregate types of interest are
      <em>sequences</em>, <em>sets</em>, and (finite)
      <em>mappings</em>.
</cite></blockquote>
    
Sometimes also bags (multi-sets) are considered as useful.  Since in
our experience bags are needed very seldom, and in order to keep the
library small, bags are not included currently. <p>
 
A graph is perhaps a basic aggregate, but since of its many logical
variants and even more possible representations, graphs are out of our
scope. (But note that a convenient representation of Graphs is given
by the mapping Map&lt;Node,Set&lt;Node&gt;&gt.). <p>

So we end up with just the named three basic aggregate types.  Lists,
arrays, vectors, search trees, hash-tables and so on are just variants
of different implementations of these types.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Aggregates are Values</h3>


<blockquote><cite>
      Aggregates are always values that is objects
      with immutable state (just as java.lang.String).
</cite></blockquote>

Programming with immutable aggregates is usually more convenient and
always less error-prone then with mutable ones. This has been
demonstrated by functional languages, but also scripting languages
such as Perl. So immutable variants of the aggregate types should be
provided in any case.<p>

For reasons of efficiency, one might think it is in addition necessary
to provide mutable versions of aggregates, such as e.g. done for
strings with <code>StringBuffer</code> in Java. We believe such a
design significantly overloads the concept space, providing technical
different interfaces for conceptual identical things. <p>

The efficiency problem is not as large as usually supposed. In
particular, the <em> costs of immutability can be constant</em> if an
aggregate value is used single-threaded.  To illustrate the basic
principle, consider a loop such as

<pre>
  Seq&lt;A&gt; s = new ... ;
  while (...) s = s.append(...);
</pre>

In the loop, the program exclusively works on the ``newest'' variant
of <code>s</code>. An implementation can support this common
situation, by propagating owner ship on internal storage of aggregates
as they are transformed to new ones. Only if ``old'' values are going
to be accessed again, copying of internal storage may become
necessary. This has been demonstrated e.g. by techniques known under
the catchword of <em>version arrays</em> (used for the implementation
of monolithic arrays in pure functional languages), or by so-called
<em>mbuf</em>'s (used for representing enveloped messages in the
TCP/IP implementation of BSD unices). <p>

Though the costs of immutability are in average constant, they are of
course existent. Here are some benchmarks, comparing the
current implementation of immutable aggregates with mutable ones in
Java and Pizza:<p>

<center>
<table border>
<tr>
  <th> benchmark </th>
  <th> java.util </th>
  <th> pizza.util </th>
  <th> pizza.agl </th>
  <th> costs </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>appending (Vector / BufferSeq)</td>
  <td align=right>136</td>
  <td align=right>194</td>
  <td align=right>240</td>
  <td align=center>1.7 / 1.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>including (mutable Set / HashSet)</td>
  <td align=right>-</td>
  <td align=right>334</td>
  <td align=right>658</td>
  <td align=center>- / 2.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>defining (Hashtable / HashMap)</td>
  <td align=right>355</td>
  <td align=right>371</td>
  <td align=right>707</td>
  <td align=center>2.0 / 1.9</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>

We append/include/define 10000 elements, respectivly. Absolut timings
are in milliseconds with JDK 1.1.3 on a Pentium
200. <code>BufferSeq</code> is an implementation variant of immutable
sequences using the mbuf technique.  <code>HashSet</code> is a variant
of immutable sets based on hashing and version array techniques, as is
<code>HashMap</code> for finite mappings.<p>

The results should be taken with care, since the costs of garbage
collection are not explicitely measured. Immutable aggregates create a
lot of more intermediate objects as mutable ones do. Techniques such
as generational copying GC have less problems with such temporary
objects on the heap, but mark&scan (used in the JDK, as far as we know,)
will need to touch them.<p>

<h3>Implementation Variants</h3>

<blockquote><cite>
      Aggregates come in several semantic
      equivalent <em>implementation variants</em> which 
      extend one of the basic aggregate types (sequence, set,
      or mapping).
</cite></blockquote>

Different implementations of the same basic aggregate type have
different efficiency according to how they are applied.  For example,
if sets are small and operations such as union and intersection are
frequently performed, a representation as an ordered list is more
efficient then as a hash-table or as a balanced tree. <p>

We model these different representations by so-called
<em>implementation variants</em>, which extend one one of the basic
aggregate types, sequence, set, or mapping. Thereby, an important
assertion is that implementation variants are semantically
equivalent. So a user may prototype a program don't caring about the
efficiency of aggregate implementations, adding decisions about this
in a later stage. <p>

Choosing an implementation variant is achieved by calling the
constructor of its class.  In declarations, one always uses the
abstract superclass of the basic aggregate type. For example

<pre>
  Seq&lt;A&gt; s = new BufferSeq(...);
</pre>

where <code>BufferSeq</code> is the constructor of the class of
implementation variants for sequences based on mbufs. <p>

Methods which deliver new aggregates are typed to return a value of
the abstract superclass, not of the implementation variant. Thus the
missing covariance in Pizzas/Java's type system doesn't causes a
problem.  For example:

<pre>
  abstract class Seq&lt;A&gt; extends Aggregate&lt;A&gt; {
    ...
    abstract Seq&lt;A&gt; append(...);
    ...
  }
  class BufferSeq&lt;A&gt; extends Seq&lt;A&gt; {
    ...
    Seq&lt;A&gt; append(...);
    ...
  }
</pre>

To model conversion between different implementation variants, each
variant supplies a constructor which takes an other variant and
converts it to its own representation. For the class
<code>BufferSeq</code>, this would be

<pre>
  class BufferSeq&lt;A&gt; extends Seq&lt;A&gt; {
    ...
    BufferSeq(Seq&lt;A&gt; other){...}
    ...
  }
</pre>

In general, the implementation of these conversion constructors is
optimized with respect to what variant is actually passed (using
dynamic type tests). In particular, if the passed aggregate is an
instance of the same implementation variant, then the constructor
behaves as an identity on the representation. This supports
code such as
<pre>
  Seq&lt;A&gt; s;                         // s with some unknown implementation
  ...
  s = new BufferSeq(s);             // ensure s is represented as a buffer 
  while (...) s = s.append(...);    // add elements to s
  ...
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Parameter Constraints</h3>

<blockquote><cite>
      Both styles of defining properties of element
      types of aggregates have to be supported: by the type system,
      using interface constraints, and by passing additional
      information to constructors.
</cite></blockquote>

Some implementation variants demand properties from their generic
parameters, such as that their exists a total ordering on the
aggregated elements. Such properties are naturally expressed by
interface constraints, such as in

<pre>
  class AvlSet&lt;A implements Ordered&lt;A&gt;&gt; extends Set&lt;A&gt; {...}
</pre>
  
Unfortunately, this approach is problematic since (1) given types from
other packages do not implement the <code>Ordered</code> interface,
and their is no possibility to attach such implementations a posteriori (2)
Pizza/Java does not supports a way to propagate interface constraints
(``if A is Ordered, then Seq&lt;A&gt; is Ordered'').<p>

We hope that future versions of Pizza/Java will give solutions to
these problems, and for the moment use a compromise, where we
introduce for each implementation variant with parameter constraints
two versions, which are conceptually related as illustrated below:

<pre>
  class AvlSetP&lt;A&gt; extends Set&lt;A&gt;{
    AvlSetP((A,A)->int,...){...}
    ...
  }
  class AvlSet&lt;A implements Ordered&lt;A&gt;&gt; extends AvlSetP&lt;A&gt;{
    AvlSet(...){ 
      super(fun (A x,A y)->int{ return x.compare(y); }, ...);
    }
    ...
  }
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Similarity between the basic Aggregate Types</h3>

<blockquote><cite> It is not necessary and not even
desirable to express maximal similarity between the basic aggregates
by inheritance.  </cite></blockquote>

A typical inheritance relation found in the literature is
<code>Set&lt;A&gt; extends Seq&lt;A&gt;</code>, and
<code>Map&lt;A,B&gt; extends Set&lt;Pair&lt;A,B&gt;&gt;</code>.  We
don't think that it is necessary to represent this relation in the
aggregate library. On the programming level, a set is a different
concept then a sequence, and a map is a different concept then a
set. A programmer should decide which of these concepts is going to be
used in an early design stage.<p>

Yet, similarity is expressed by a common superclass of all aggregate
types. This leads to the following inheritance hierarchy of depth 3:

<pre>
			     Aggregate
	  Seq		       Set		     Map
 ArraySeq BufferSeq ...   HashSet AvlSet ...     HashMap AvlMap ... 
</pre>

Thereby, the abstract class Aggregate provides unified methods
for <em>traversing</em> aggregates:
<pre>
  abstract class Aggregate&lt;A&gt; {
    abstract Enum&lt;A&gt; enum();
    abstract &lt;B&gt; B reduce(B zero, (B,A)->B cons);
    ...
  }
</pre>

We have also considered a variant where <code>Aggregate</code> is in fact an
interface, which is parameterized over the aggregate representation,
such that we can also define unique methods which construct aggregates:

<pre>
  interface Aggregate&lt;AGG,A&gt;{
    abstract Enum&lt;A&gt; enum();
    abstract &lt;B&gt; B reduce(B zero, (B,A)->B cons);
    &lt;AGGB> AGG insert(Aggregate&lt;AGGB,A&gt; agg);
    ...
  }

  abstract class Set&lt;A&gt; implements Aggregate&lt;Set&lt;A&gt;,A&gt; {
    &lt;AGGB&gt; Set&lt;A&gt; insert(Aggregate&lt;AGGB,A&gt; agg);
    ...
  }
</pre>  

We have turned down this alternative approach since first we are not
sure about its actual value (algorithms which <em>construct</em>
aggregates and are independent of whether the logical structure is a
sequence, a set or a map don't come to our mind), and second since we
believe the construction is to sophisticated for beginners to
understand.<p>


<hr>
<h3>Enumerations</h3>

<blockquote><cite>
      The enumeration interface is revised.
      Functionals on enumerations are not provided.
</cite></blockquote>	

Since enumerations have state, they should be only used as temporary
objects for formulating loops in method bodys. We believe it is not a
good programming style to pass enumerations as parameters or store
them in fields.  To enforce this restricted use of enumerations, the
functionals as known from <code>pizza.util.Enumerator</code> are not
supported.<p>

Furthermore, we propose a different interface for enumerations,
which emphasizes the state view, and uses shorter names (since
enumerations are used quite often in practice):

<pre>
  interface Enum&lt;A&gt;{
    boolean more(); A current(); void advance();
  }
</pre>	

This leads to code such as
<pre>
  for (Enum&lt;A&gt; e = agg.enumerate(); e.more(); e.advance()){
    // do something with e.current()
  }
</pre>

instead of the <code>while</code> loops induced by the current
enumeration interface.<p>

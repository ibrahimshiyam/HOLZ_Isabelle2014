\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  Use cases are a wide-spread \emph{informal} method for specifying
  the requirements of a technical system in the early development
  phase. In this example, we present an example of using
  use cases
  in Executable Z\footnote{A full version of this work
    can be found at 
    \url{http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/~wg/papers/ucases.ps.gz}}.
\end{abstract}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% a macro to open an array inside of Z text
\newcommand{\zblock}[2][2pt]{
  {\arraycolsep#1\begin{array}[t]{lcll}#2\end{array}}}

% this directive lets ESZ ignore the macro:
%% \zsection{UseCases}
%%macro \zblock 1 #1

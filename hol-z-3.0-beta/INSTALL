Prerequistes:
=============
0) Download the following programs:
- Install a LaTeX distribution.
- ZeTa:  http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/zeta/zetadist1_5.class
- Isabelle 05: see http://isabelle.in.tum.de/download.html
- PolyML: http://www.polyml.org/download.html
  or 
  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 110.42 or later
  http://www.smlnj.org/NEWS/110-README.html
- we assume java, jar, tar, gunzip to be installed on your system.
   
1) Install ZeTa and your SML system (PolyML or SML of New Jersey) as described 
   in their documentation.
   2a) In particular, make sure that latex will find the zeta.sty-file. 
   2b) Further, make sure that the zeta shell script (which is executed if you
   zype "zeta" does not overwrite the class path in the zeta shell script. 
   You have to adjust the script <ZETADIST>/bin/zeta by exchanging the line:

       CLASSPATH="$ZETABASE/lib/classes.jar"
   by 
       CLASSPATH="$ZETABASE/lib/classes.jar":$CLASSPATH

   (see additionally doc/holz-adaptor.html)

2) Install Standard ML of New Jersey, or PolyML

3) Install Isabelle 2005 as described in its documentation. An example
   settings for PolyML can be found in "etc/settings.new".

4) Proceed with the HOL-Z installation.

HOL-Z Installation:
===================

1) After unpacking the HOL-Z 3.0 (which you must have done in order to 
   get this file, go to the HOL-Z directory, and edit the file make.config for your specific
   settings, especially the path of ZeTa and Isabelle.

2) Compile HOL-Z. Just go to src and type "isatool make".
   In case of LaTeX-errors, reconsider item 2a).

3) Compile the HOL-Z adaptor. This is a java-written component which is plugged
   into zeta providing an export-facility (i.e. this is the component that technically
   generates a .holz-file) 

4) Start HOL-Z by:

         Isabelle -L HOL-Z




HOL-Z Installation Test:
========================
Goto examples/bbook.
You can either type:

	isatool make bbook

or even:

        isatool make

In the previous case, if correctly installed, HOL-Z
should respond with:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

= good bye.
mv document/*.holz holz
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

That is, isatool starts ZETA, which extracts from the
specification document under document/session.tex the
Z sources, type-chacks it and exports the exchange
files .holz which were copied to the holz directory.
(Currently, we are not supporting the ZAP and ZAM
animators any more ... sorry).

In the latter case, isatool starts performs additionally
"Running HOL-Z-bbook" which starts Isabelle, engages in a 
proof check of BB.thy and finally generates a .pdf of
the generated LaTeX:

Finished HOL-Z-bbook (0:02:31 elapsed time)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The third-last line indicates to where the generated document.pdf
is actually copied - usually inside some place in the isabelle
user space.

Have fun !

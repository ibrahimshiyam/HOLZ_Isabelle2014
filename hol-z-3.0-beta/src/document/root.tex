\chapter{Abstract} 
HOL-Z is a proof environment for Z built as plug-in of the generic
theorem prover Isabelle/HOL (Version 2005). It allows for importing Z
specifications written in LaTeX and type-checked by the Javadfgdfg-based
ZeTa â€“ System. HOL-Z then allows for the formal analysis of such
specifications, i.e. by proving the conjectures stated in the
specfication, generating proof obligations concerning the consistency
of state and operation schemas as well as their proof, and by
generating proof obligations resulting from refinement statements for
functional and data refinement.

Proof documents containing lemmas, analytical statements, proofs and
global checks were written in an extension of the Isabelle/ISAR proof
language and can be edited with the emacs-based ProofGeneral
interface.


\chapter{Introduction}
We present a new proof environment for the specification language Z.
The basis is a semantic representation of Z in a structure-preserving,
shallow em- bedding in Isabelle/HOL. On top of the embedding, new
proof support for the Z schema calculus and for proof structuring are
developed. Thus, we integrate Z into a well-known and trusted theorem
prover with advanced deduction technology such as higher-order
rewriting, tableaux-based provers and arithmetic decision
procedures. A further achievement of this work is the integration of
our embedding into a new tool- chain providing a Z-oriented type
checker, documentation facilities and macro support for refinement
proofs; as a result, the gap has been closed between a logical
embedding proven correct and a tool suited for applications of
non-trivial size.

As a proof environment allowing interactive proof (although comprising
highly sophisticated automated proof procedures), HOL-Z assumes two
different stakeholders during the development process: the
\emph{designer} and the \emph{proof engineer}. Both will have
different interests, may have different educational background and
should have a different prespective to a given modeling problem.  The
particular toolchain, into which HOL-Z 3.0 is embedded, allows for the
two parties to work together and make a question/answer game during
the development phase. The designers question might be: ("does
conjecture X hold"? "Is A a refinement of B"?, while answers of the
proof engineer might be: "Yes, provided that you change definition Y
as follows: ...".  This toolchain is also reflected by a particular
workflow depicted below:

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/workflow}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The HOL-Z Workflow\label{fig:work-flow}}
\end{figure}

The designers side (the \emph{modeling phase}) is 
essentially an editor plus a light-weight type-checker ZeTa, which
is just a JAVA app which releases the designer from the quite
heavy burden to install full Isabelle. Via a plug-in into ZeTa, 
the designer can export his/her models to the proof engineers side
(the \emph{verification phase}) which consists of an enhanced
editor (ProofGeneral based on Emacs) editing proof documents
which were incrementally checked by Isabelle/HOL-Z.

\chapter{Starting HOL-Z}
Having installed Isabelle/HOL-Z correctly, the system can be started 
for the interactive mode by the standard launcher:

\begin{verbatim}
$ISABELLE/bin/Isabelle -L HOL-Z
\end{verbatim}

where the shell variable \verb+$ISABELLE+ denotes the home of the Isabelle
package in your file system. Do not forget the option  \verb+-L HOL-Z+ which
lets ProofGeneral, when started via the launcher, load a a keyword-file
containing information on the HOL-Z specific keywords.

For the batch mode, Isabelle can be started via:
\begin{verbatim}
$ISABELLE/bin/isatool make
\end{verbatim}
provided the usual Isamakefile has been set up. (See Isabelle system documentation).

\chapter{HOL-Z Commands in the ISAR Language}
We assume that the reader is familiar with the Isabelle/Isar Reference Manual for
Isabelle 2005. Given the fact that HOL-Z is just a plug-in into the Isabelle 
framework, its command-language is just a superset of the Isabelle/HOL ISAR command language.

The ISAR command language assumes a general theory file with
a header containing thory dependencies, \emph{toplevel commands} and
\emph{prooflevel commands} (which can only be entered after certain toplevel commands
let the system enter the proof mode). Furthermore, there are \emph{proof methods} which
are arguments of the preconceived prooflevel command \verb+apply+.

\section{HOL-Z Toplevel and Prooflevel Commands}

There are three general toplevel commands:
\begin{verbatim}
  load_holz "<string>"

  zlemma <name> : "<HOL-Z>"

  po "<po-name>"
\end{verbatim}
The first command just includes .holz files generated by ZeTa
containing the Z model provided by the designer. Note that in current
HOL-Z, the string must be the same as the name of the surrounding
theory (otherwise problems with namespaces will arise).  The second
command is an equivalent to the standard \verb+lemma+-command, but
uses an own parser for the mixture of e-mail-format or latex-format Z
expressions.  The last comment takes the name of a generated
obligation; in the sequel, the system is in proof mode (of this
obligation).

Most commands are part of the package that implements support for
the Z Refinement method.

There are a number of generic commands controlling the proof-obligation management:
\begin{verbatim}
   list_po       [except <po-class-name>]
   show_po       <po-name>+
   check_po      [except <po-class-name>]
   discharge_po  <po-name> 
\end{verbatim}
The first command causes a listing of the proof-obligations which are
currently not resolved (not "discharged"). Certain pre-conceived
classes of proof obligations (for the Z language, there are: "tcc",
"axdefConservative", "ccState", "ccOp", "fwRefinementFunctional",
"fwRefinementInit", "fwRefinementOp") can be excluded from listing or checking.
The second allow for the display of a given proof obligation, the third succeeds
only if none of the proof obligations remained undischarged (except those
explicitly excluded from the check). The last command can only be executed in 
a proof-state when no logical subgoals remained unproven. It corresponds roughly to
the standard command \verb+done+ but will only work for proofs started with
the \verb+po+ command (see below).

Then there is a number of Z Method specific commands related to analysis by
proof obligation management:
\begin{verbatim}
   gen_state_cc <name>
   gen_op_cc    <name>
   gen_thm_cc   <name>

   set_abs <name> ["[" functional "]" ]
   refine_init <name> <name>
   refine_op   <name> <name>
\end{verbatim}
The first group of commands generates proof-obligations related to the consistency of
Z condtructs: The first the existence of a state satisfying a state invariant captured
by a state schema, the second captures the functional implementability of an operation schema,
while the third captures the side-conditions related to the Z application operator, which
requires that each function symbol is only applied to an argument within its domain
(Not implemented at present).

The latter three commands are related o the refinement package. \verb+set_abs+ initializes
the package with the abstraction predicate (which also comprises syntactic checks). If the option
\verb+[functional]+ is set, the proof obligations for functional refinement were generated.
\verb+refine_init+ generates the proof obligations with resp. to the initialization schemas,
 \verb+refine_ops+ the the obligations for operations (depending if the refinement is done
in a relational or a functional setting).

\section{Proof Methods}
The following proof methods are available:
\begin{verbatim}
   zstrip  ["(" <goal-nr> ")" ]
   zunfold ["(" <goal-nr> ")" ] <thmname>+
   zrule   ["(" <goal-nr> ")" ] <thmname>+
   zfrule  ["(" <goal-nr> ")" ] <thmname>+
   zdrule  ["(" <goal-nr> ")" ] <thmname>+
   zerule  ["(" <goal-nr> ")" ] <thmname>+
\end{verbatim}
\verb+zstrip+ erases the topmost schema-logical operations, in
particular schema universal quantification, schema existential
quantification, or schema implications. Standard HOL universal
quantifications were also eliminted. The method does its best to
rename variables such that the resulting proof state is still
readable.  The other methods are the Z-logical equivalents to the
standard methods \verb+unfold+,\verb+rule+, \verb+erule+,\verb+frule+,
\verb+drule+, \verb+erule+, but they perform an internal \verb+zstrip+
on the resolvend and a cleanup-phase for type-checking related
constraints afterwards.

\section{Modifiers (Attributes)}
The following modifiers (called attributes in isabelle-terminology) are available:
\begin{verbatim}
   <thm>  "["zstrip"]"
   <thm>  "["zdecl "["<nr>"]""]"
   <thm>  "["zpred "["<nr>"]""]"   
\end{verbatim}
They correspond to forward reasoning.  \verb+zstrip+ erases the
topmost schema-logical operations, in particular schema universal
quantification, schema existential quantification, or schema
implications. Standard HOL universal quantifications were also
eliminted. The method does its best to rename variables such that the
resulting proof state is still readable. (see also the proof method
zstrip above which does the same in backward reasoning).  \verb+zdecl+
constructs from a schema a projection lemma (in HOL-Z syntax) into the
n`th conjoint in the declaration part of schema; \verb+zpred+
constructs from a schema a projection lemma (in HOL-Z syntax) into the
n`th conjoint in the predicate part this schema.


\section{Miscellaneous}
There is a collection of definitions for Z, called \verb+Z2HOL+, which
allows for the conversion of a number of schema or binding related
operators to standard HOL constructs. This rule set can be used by the
simplifier or the standard unfold commands.


\chapter{Isabelle Theories}
The main dependencies  are shown in Fig.~\vref{fig:session_graph}.  is build on top 
of Isabelle/HOL.\footnote{More precise,  is build on top 
of Isabelle/HOL-Complex but only to support real numbers. If you dont't
need them,  should be build just fine on top of a plain Isabelle/HOL.}

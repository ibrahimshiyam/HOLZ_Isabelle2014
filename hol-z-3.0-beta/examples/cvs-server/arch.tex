\begin{abstract}
  We present a secure architecture of a CVS-server, its implementation (i.e.\ 
  mainly its configuration) and its formal analysis. Our CVS-server uses
  cvsauth~\cite{vogt:cvsauth:2001}, that provides protection of passwords and
  protection of some internal data of the CVS repository. In contrast to other
  (security oriented) CVS-architectures, our approach makes it possible to
  CVS-server on an open filesystem, i.e.\ a filesystem where users can have
  direct access both by CVS-commands and by standard UNIX/POSIX commands such as
  \unixcmd{mv}. A key feature of our implementation is that it enforces a
  particular access control model, namely role-based access control (RBAC).
  
  For our secure architecture of the CVS-server, we provide a formal
  specification and security analysis. This is based on a refinement, mapping a
  system architecture on an implementation architecture abstractly describing
  CVS in our implementation. The system architecture describes the abstract
  system operations including the desired access control model RBAC and serves
  as backbone to describe overall security requirements formally. The
  implementation architecture --- to be seen as an abstract program ---
  describes the security mechanisms on the UNIX/POSIX filesystem level, namely
  discretionary access control (DAC).
 
  The purpose of the formal analysis of the secure CVS-server architecture is
  twofold: First, we describe our implementation, in particular the access
  control for our open architecture. Second, we provide a method to analyze
  formally security implementations (beyond the code level) for realistic
  applications in terms of off-the-shelf security technologies.

This is the home of the CVS-Server case study, an analysis
in applied system security (see [1] for an overview). It
consists of an abstract system architecture model for CVS 
(including an role-based-access control model), an 
implementation architecture model (based on the "real"
posix-descretionary access control mechanism), a refinement
established between these two and a behavioral security
analysis based on inductive techniques.

So far, no attempt has been undertaken to port these proofs
to HOL-Z 3.0.

This directory contains:
- the specification (also called the "Technical Report" [2])
- the holz-subdirectory with the generated
  .holz files (extracted from the specification via the zeta-
  plugin) and the .ML-proofscripts
- the usual make-infrastructure for HOL-Z projects
  based on the zeta-frontend

The current ROOT.ML is empty, when loading specific proofs,
go into the holz directory and load specific theories
directly (e.g. by ´use_holz "SysArchSec"´).

Acknowledgement:
Most of the proofs in holz have been developped by
Harald Hiss as part of his Studien- and Diplomarbeit.

The Steamboiler-Examples is an additional e-mail format based example 
(compare the reference Birthdaybook-example examples/bbook and 
 examples/zeta/bbook) to demonstrate the use of HOL-Z2.0.
This version of bbook (the other can be found under examples/zeta/bbook)
is tailored to demonstrate the direct, light-weighed use of HOL-Z
based on the e-mail format integrated into the standard .thy-format
of Isabelle.

While this mode has its advantages for small specifications and 
experiments, we encourage the use of the ZeTa-based approach for
larger specifications. Such larger examples (including their
tex - and make setup) can be found under examples/zeta.
For more details, consult the README of the corresponding 
zeta/bbook version.

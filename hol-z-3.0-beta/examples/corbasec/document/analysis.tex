\section{Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}

In this section, we describe the analysis of our, and hence the OMG's
specification.


\subsection{Attacker scenarios}
\label{sec:attacker}

In this section, we define some attacker scenarios which help us guide the
analysis process.

\begin{itemize}
\item an attacker may insert a malicious object
\item someone calls legal operations with illegal parameters
\item can an attacker gain access to the internal data of an ORB
\item security association
\item attack against the interface repository
\item interception of communication between ORBs and/or objects
\item difference between security aware and unaware applications
\end{itemize}
